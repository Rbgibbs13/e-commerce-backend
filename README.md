Backend Setup for E-Commerce website

## Usage
To use the e-commerce backend, download the files to your local machine.  
Run ```npm install``` in the CLI when you have your files open in a text editor.  
After the install has completed, run ```npm run seed``` to seed the database.  
Finally run ```npm run start``` in the CLI to start the backend server.  

## Description
This is an e-commerce backend that tracks products, tags and categories. The products, categories and tags are paired with through-tables allowing you to access tag and category data when you query the database for products.

## About
I used a lot of documentation for this. Primarily https://sequelize.org/docs/v7/querying/update/

I think some MDN and various other major websites were also used.  
The lessons were helpful but there were quite a few things in here that were not fully covered, so I had to go to other sources.  
  
I fixed the couple bugs that were at the end of the posted video. I re-tested and everything ran how it should (I hope).
